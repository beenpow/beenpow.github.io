# EXPERIENCE
- __Samsung Electronics__ _Software Engineer_ (Sep 2020 - Current)
  - Engineered performance improvements in Android Runtime (ART) and compilation pipeline, reducing app launch times by 15% through prelaunch execution, prioritized compilation, and artifact recovery.
  - Developed automated boot performance tracing and regression testing infrastructure, leveraging systrace to capture process-level (PID) activity and identify bottlenecks across OS versions and device models.
  - Automated Android Runtime and boot-time testing with Python and shell scripts to collect multi-run averages and improve result reliability, enabling faster root-cause analysis in performance investigations.
  - Enhanced Android system stability by extending monitoring mechanisms and analyzing inter-process communication usage, preventing stalls and ensuring responsiveness of critical services.
  - Collaborated with Google Android and Qualcomm engineers to reproduce and diagnose OS-level issues across Pixel and Galaxy devices, driving upstream fixes and accelerating integration into Samsung products.

- __Continental Automotive Electronics__ _Software Engineer_ (Jan 2018 - July 2020)
  - Developed real-time in-vehicle communication systems using Ethernet-based digital dashboards for Hyundai vehicles, ensuring low-latency and robust performance.
  - Integrated software modules on ARM-based cores within an AUTOSAR RTOS, handling scheduling, process priorities, and debugging with hardware tools.
  - Collaborated with global R&D teams (Singapore, Germany) using CI pipelines, hardware-in-the-loop validation, and real-world testing.

- __HappyTel__ _Technician_ (Jul 2016 - May 2017)
  - Provided repair services for Samsung Galaxy, Apple iPhone, and iPad devices while managing accessory sales.
  - Enhanced understanding of mobile technology through hands-on experience with internal components and configurations.
