# COFO::659E New Reform
- [Link : COFO::659E](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/659/E)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : data structures, dfs and similar, dsu, graphs, greedy
- TIME
  - to understand    : 
  - to algorithm     : fail
  - to code          : 
  - to debug         : 
  - understanding edit :  5

### Point
- n cities, m bidirectional roads
- we are trying to change bidirectional roads into one directional roads
- Find the minimum number of seprate cities
- separate city : no city has road to this city

### Design
- Almost solved it
- But the one thing that I've missed it that, for the one connected graph, 
  - I thought that 'count of roads could be less than vertices - 1 in the connected graph'
  - To connect x cities, at least x -1 roads are needed.
  - So, no need to thought that way.
- There's only two ways for the connected graph when there are x vertices in it
  - x - 1 roads
  - greater than (x-1) roads
- We check each connected graph, and see how many roads in it. (Especially compare with 'x-1' value)
  - And if it has x-1 roads, there will be an separate city.

### Complexity
- O(n + m)

### Code

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 1e5 + 9;


int vertices, roads;
vector<int> visited;
vector<int> grp[MAXN];


void dfs(int v) {
    visited[v] = true;
    vertices++;
    
    roads += sz(grp[v]);
    for (int u : grp[v]) {
        if (visited[u]) continue;
        dfs(u);
    }
}

void solve() {
    int n, m; cin >> n >> m;
    visited.resize(n + 1);
    
    rep(i, 1, m + 1) {
        int u, v; cin >> u >> v;
        grp[u].push_back(v);
        grp[v].push_back(u);
    }
    
    int sum = 0;
    rep(i, 1, n + 1) {
        if (visited[i]) continue;
        vertices = roads = 0;
        dfs(i);

        roads /= 2;
        if (vertices == roads + 1)
            sum ++;
    }
    cout << sum << '\n';
}

int main(){
    solve();
    return 0;
}
```
