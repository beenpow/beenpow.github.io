# COFO::1455D Sequence and Swaps
- [Link : COFO::1455D](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1455/D)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : dp, greedy, sortings
- TIME
  - to understand    : 10
  - to algorithm     : 35
  - to code          : 15
  - to debug         : 10
  - understanding edit : 5

### Point
- Array 'a' and value 'x' are given
- Find the minimal number of operations which makes the array 'a' sorted
- operation
  - For i, a[i] > x
  - swap(a[i], x)

### Design

#### greedy
- I solved as greedy
- Let's think about 'x'.
  - Since we can swap x with a[i] only if a[i] > x, we can notice that x is getting greater after operations
- Now, we can think about with naive-way
- How can we get 'a' sorted after any number of operations?
  - It's easy, we can swap a[i] and x whenever it's possible
  - Then we can check if it's sorted
- We can make 'a' sorted with above way, but sometimes it's not minimum, why is that?
- Because, there are some indices that we don't need to swap
- How can we know that whether this a[i] needs to be changed or not
  - We can check the next spot of a[i + m] > a[i + m + 1]
    - We have to change it like, a[i + m] < a[i + m + 1]
    - So, we check if x >= a[i+m] or a[i+m-1] > x
    - If not, swap a[i] and x now
  - Which means, we have to make sure that 'x' can be used for next unsorted situation (a[i+m] > a[i+m+1])

### Complexity
- O(NlogN)

### Code

#### greedy

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

int solve() {
    int n, x; cin >> n >> x;
    vector<int> a(n + 1, 0);
    vector<int> _unsor;
    rep(i, 1, n + 1) {
        cin >> a[i];
        if (a[i-1] > a[i]) _unsor.push_back(i-1);
    }
    if (is_sorted(all(a))) return 0;
    
    int ans = 0, st = 1;
    auto t = lower_bound(all(a), x);
    if (t == a.end()) return -1;
    
    rep(i, st, n) {
        if (a[i] > x) {
            auto it = lower_bound(all(_unsor), i);
            if (it == _unsor.end()) break;
            
            int nFId = *it;
            if (nFId == i) {swap(a[i], x); ans++; continue;}
            if (x < a[nFId] && a[nFId - 1] <= x) ;
            else {
                swap(a[i], x);
                ans++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    
    
    return is_sorted(all(a)) ? ans : -1;
}
int main(){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);
    int tc; cin >> tc; while(tc--) cout << solve() << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
