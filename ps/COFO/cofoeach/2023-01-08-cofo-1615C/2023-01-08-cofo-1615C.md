# COFO::1615C Menorah
- [Link : COFO::1615C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1615/C)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : brute force, graphs, greedy, math
- TIME
  - to understand    : 10
  - to algorithm     : 47
  - to code          : 10
  - to debug         : 1
  - understanding edit : 2 

### Point
- There are two strings consist of 0 and 1
  - a and b
- Find the minimum number of operations to changge string a to string b
- If it's not possible print -1
- Operation
  - Choose index i for a[i] = 1
  - Then toggle all numbers (0 -> 1 or 1 -> 0) except a[i]

### Design
- It seemed so hard, but it's only about math
- We can find some kind of intuition when we are hand-testing the 3rd and 4th test cases
- Here's what I found and used to solve this problem
- Let's define some variables
  - from a to b
    - 0 -> 0 : e
    - 0 -> 1 : f
    - 1 -> 0 : g
    - 1 -> 1 : h
  - x = e + h (still)
  - y = f + g (changed)
- So between a and b, there are y changed numbers and x still numbers
- We have to find below point of this problem
  - When the answer is even
    - y should be even
    - Do you get it?
      - Let's say a[3] need to be changed and y is even
      - If a[3] does not have operation on it, a[3] won't be changed because it toggled even numbers, so it's can not be possible.
  - When the answer is odd
    - x should be odd
    - Then we can make x still by all number of x get operation

- And here's the mathmatical conclusion
- case scenario
  - 1) x = odd, ans = x. (y = even)
    - u : count of '0' on x
    - v : count of '1' on x
    - v == u+1 , (v > 0)
      - becuase, we can start operation with it's original a[i] is 1
      - Then, we can do operation on it's original a[i] is 0
      - It's about toggle
  - 2) x = even, ans = x. (y = even)
    - Impossible
      - because y is not operated, the y numbers will be same on the result which should be changed
  - 3) y = odd, ans = y. (x = even)
    - Impossible
      - because all y numbers are operated, they will be same on the result which should be changed
  - 4) y = even, ans = y. (x = even)
    - u : count of '0' on y
    - v : count of '1' on y
    - u == v , (v > 0)
    

### Complexity
- O(N)

    }

        y = f + g; // changed

    if (x & 1) {
        int cnt0 = e, cnt1 = h;
        if (cnt1 == cnt0 + 1 && cnt1 > 0) {
            able = true;
            ans = min(ans, x);
        }
    }
    
    if (y %2 == 0) {
        int cnt0 = g, cnt1 = f;
        if (cnt1 > 0 && cnt0 == cnt1) {
            able = true;
            ans = min(ans, y);
        }
    }
    if (!able) cout << "-1\n";
    else cout << ans << '\n';

    int tc; cin >> tc; while(tc--) solve();
