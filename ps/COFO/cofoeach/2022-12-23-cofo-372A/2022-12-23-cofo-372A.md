# COFO::372A Counting Kangaroos is Fun
- [Link : COFO::372A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/372/A)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : binary search, greedy, sortings, two pointers
- TIME
  - to understand    : 
  - to algorithm     : fail
  - to code          : 
  - to debug         : 
  - understanding edit : 1600

### Point
- There are n kangaroos.
- One kangaroo can hold another one kangaroo, then the total count for them is 1
- Find the minimum number of kangaroos left

### Design
- There was one simple but hard to find fact
  - We have to split kangaroos into two groups after sorting them
  - Because, the set of holding and holded kangaroos is n/2 as maximum
- Then it's easy to match them
  - But I couldn't figure it out during solving the problem
  - I thought that, finding larger one by lower_bound as small one * 2
  - Then it failed to match perfectly
  - Then I thought, I have to find the small one by using larger one
  - Then it failed to match perfectly
- The core reason why we seperate into two groups of kangaroos is that 
  - Because they are small ones vs big ones
  - Of course there can be a set of kanagaroos in small one group
  - ex) small group = { ..., 5, 10, ... }, large group = { 100, ... }
  - If I use '10' for '5',
    - There's no benefit from it, since I can use any smallest number from large group for '5'.
    - If I use '10' for '5' instead of '100', eventually I need to set leftover 100 to something else
    - Which means, I need to find at least 100 * 2 for it.
    - This is such a waste of using numbers

### Complexity
- O(NlogN)

### Code

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

int n;
map<int,int> _little, _big;
void solve() {
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> v;
    rep(i, 0, n) {
        int x; cin >> x;
        v.push_back(x);
    }
    sort(all(v));
    int sz = sz(v) / 2;
    rep(i, 0, sz) _little[v[i]]++;
    rep(i, sz, sz(v)) _big[v[i]]++;
    
    while(sz(_little) > 0 && sz(_big) > 0) {
        auto it = _little.begin();
        auto it2 = _big.lower_bound(it->fi * 2);
        if (it2 == _big.end()) break;
        it->se--;  if(it->se == 0) _little.erase(it->fi);
        it2->se--;if(it2->se == 0) _big.erase(it2->fi);
        n--;
    }
    cout << n << '\n';
}
int main(){
    solve();
    return 0;
}
```
