# COFO::678C Joty and Chocolate
- [Link : COFO::678C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/678/C)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : implementation, math, number theory
- TIME
  - to understand    : 5
  - to algorithm     : 3
  - to code          : 2
  - to debug         : 0
  - understanding edit : 0 

### Point
- n, a, b, p, q are given
- paint i%a == 0 positions as Red, and I will get p
- paint i%b == 0 positions as Blue, and I will get q
- For i%a == 0 && i%b == 0 postions, I can choose what to paint
- Find the maximum sum of what I would get after painting

### Design
- It was just mathmatical problem
- There's no trick, except the common values from a and b
- We only need to focus on the common values,
  - For the common values, we only decide the color for the one that has larger value max(p, q) and paint

### Complexity

### Code

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

ll n, a, b, p, q;

ll LCM(ll x, ll y) {
    if (x < y) return LCM(y, x);
    if (y == 0) return x;
    return LCM(x%y, y);
}
void solve() {
    cin >> n >> a >> b >> p >> q;
    ll cnta = n/a, cntb = n/b;
    ll _lcm = LCM(a, b);
    ll cntc = n / (a/_lcm * b);
    
    ll s = 0;
    if (p > q) s = cnta * p + (cntb - cntc) * q;
    else s = (cnta - cntc) * p + cntb * q;
    
    cout << s << '\n';
}

int main(){
    solve();
    return 0;
}
```
