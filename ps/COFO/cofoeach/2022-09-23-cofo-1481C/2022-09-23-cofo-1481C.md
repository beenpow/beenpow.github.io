# COFO::1481C Fence Painting
- [Link : COFO::1481C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1481/C)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : brute force, constructive algorithms, greedy
- TIME
  - to understand    : 
  - to algorithm     : fail
  - to code          : 
  - to debug         : 
  - understanding edit :  15
- The idea for the problem wasn't hard
- But there could be lots of holes by impelementing it.

### Point
- There are n planks on the fence.
- Each plank has a color on it.
- Array a, b, c will be given and their length will be n, n, m
- At first, all planks are colored as a color
  - ex) [i]th plank has a[i] color
- And, it's necessary to change colors from a to b
- There are m painters who can color a plank to c[i]
  - And they will come in a row : [m]th painter will paint as a last painter
- If array a colors can be changed to b colors, print 'yes' and print who's color is painted to where
- Otherwise, print 'no'

### Design
- The idea of doing it was not that hard.
- The way to solve this problem is simple, 
  - Find indicies which has different color between a[i] and b[i]
  - And select painters who can paint a[i] to b[i]
  - Then there will be leftoveer indicies, color them to index 'X'.
  - 'X' index can be the one  which is painted by [m] th painter.
  - Since, he's gonna re-paint this color to index 'X' at last, anyother color can be painted at this position.
- I knew the idea and tried solved it, but failed on test case 22.
  - I guess I made a few holes in the code.
- But the edit's way to handle it is very simple and clear.
- I tired to use multimap, but it's better to use vector.

### Complexity
- O(N)

### Code
