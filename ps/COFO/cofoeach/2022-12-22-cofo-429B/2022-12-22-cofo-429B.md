# COFO::429B Working out
- [Link : COFO::429B](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/429/B)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : dp
- TIME
  - to understand    : 
  - to algorithm     : fail
  - to code          : 
  - to debug         : 
  - understanding edit : 30

### Point
- Find the maximal sum of paths of two horses
  - One starts from (1, 1) and ends at (n, m)
  - One starts from (1, m) and ends at (n, 1)
- They need to meet in only one place and for the place (i, j), a[i][j] won't need to added to the sum

### Design
- This problem is so good except the fact that the problem is bit ambiguous about time.
  - It only refers 'Note, that lahub and lahubina can perform workouts with different speed, so the number of cells that they use to reach meet cell may differes'
  - There has to be more specific information about the path.
  - Now I found that as 'announcement' which is announced during the contest
  - "Two paths of the Iahub and Iahubina must have only one common cell. The time doesn't matter when you consider common points.
  - Since I was not doing the test, only solving this problem so couldn't find this information when I was solving
- Anyway, two paths has to have only one common cell on their paths
- Then it makes problem simple
- Let's say they meet at (x, y), then there's only two ways to have common cell on their paths
  - Let's call Iahub as 'A' (starts from (1,1))
  - Let's call Iahubnia as 'B' (starts from (1, m))
  - They both can not come from (x, y-1), because only one cell should be common
  - So the only way to meet the requirement is that
    - A comes from (x-1, y) and goes to (x+1, y) meanwhile, B comes from (x, y-1) and goes to (x, y+1)
    - Or, vice versa
  - As you can imagine, there will be totally 8 ways to meet at (x, y) but except above 2 cases, they all have at least two common cells.
- Now we can solve this problem as dynamic programming starts from (1, 1), (1, m), (n, 1), (n, m) goes to the common one
- And find the answer as the maximal one

### Complexity
- O(NM)

### Code

#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)

        ans = max(ans, (dp1[i-1][j] + dp4[i+1][j]) + (dp2[i][j+1] + dp3[i][j-1]));
        ans = max(ans, (dp1[i][j-1] + dp4[i][j+1]) + (dp2[i-1][j] + dp3[i+1][j]));
