# COFO::1358C Celex Update
- [Link : COFO::1358C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1358/C)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : math
- TIME
  - to understand    : 5
  - to algorithm     : 105
  - to code          : 5
  - to debug         : 5
  - understanding edit :  0

### Point
- There's a array made by 'celex'
- When start and end point is given, find the different sums of elements for all such paths
  - You can only move 'right' or 'down'

### Design
- I spent so much time on drawing the array and tried to find the trick
- And here's the one
  - We can find the sorted increasing array
    - [1, 5] -> [2, 4] -> [3, 3] -> [4, 2] -> [5, 1]
    - The value will be 11 - > 12 -> 13 -> 14 ->15
- So, the fact that the diagonal path consists of increased numbers can help to find the answer
- Let's say 
  - Start point ( 1, 1 ) , end point (3, 5)
  - The smallest some of path will be
    - [1,1] -> [1,2] -> [1, 3] -> [1, 4] -> [1, 5] -> [2, 5] -> [3, 5]
    - Now we call the sum of this path as 'x'
  - Then if we swap one dot from above path,
    - [1,1] -> [1,2] -> [1, 3] -> [1, 4] -> [2, 4] -> [2, 5] -> [3, 5]
    - We will have the sum as 'x + 1'
    - Because we know that value of [2, 4] is value of [1, 5] + 1
- And we can use above pattern to find the answer
  - Since we can have numbers from x to x + a, we need to find a
  - And the answer will be a + 1
- One of easist ways to get the answer is
  - Find all dots from n * m matrix
  - Then subtract (n + m - 1) and plus 1
  - It means,
    - There are n * m dots, and every time we change a dot we will get one more of way
    - And the reason why we subtract is that we have remove the left most and down most lines
    - The path that goes left line and bottom line of n * m rectangle

### Complexity
- O(1)

### Code

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

void solve() {
    ll x1, y1, x2, y2; cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
    if (x1 == x2 ||  y1 == y2) cout << "1\n";
    else {
        ll n = abs(x1 - x2) + 1, m = abs(y1 - y2) + 1;
        cout << n * m - (n + m - 1) +1 << '\n';
    }
}
int main(){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);
    int tc; cin >> tc; while(tc--){
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```
