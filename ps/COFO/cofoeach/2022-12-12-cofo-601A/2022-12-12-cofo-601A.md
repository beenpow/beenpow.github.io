# COFO::601A The Two Routes
- [Link : COFO::601A](https://codeforces.com/contest/601/problem/A)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : graphs, shortest paths
- TIME
  - to understand    : 
  - to algorithm     : fail
  - to code          : 
  - to debug         : 
  - understanding edit : 40

### Point
- There are n cities
- Between city A and B, there's either road or railway
- We get railways as an input
- Bus and Train starts at 1 and try to get there at n as fast as possible
- Find the minimal time that the bus and train get to the n
 - Bus and train can not be placed at the same place
 - It takes 1 from city to city 

### Design
- There is a trick at this problem
- With glimpse, I thought that 'how can I manage bfs for both and not to be placed at the same place?'
- But, we only need to find either train's or bus's shortest path to the N
- Because there is always either road or railway between 1 and n cities.
- So the one can get to the n by time 1, need to wait there.

### Complexity
- O(n^3)

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i=(a);i<(b);i++)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 1e3 + 9;
const int inf = MAXN;

int n, m;
int g[MAXN][MAXN];

void solve(){
    cin >> n >> m;
    rep(i, 0, m){
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;
        g[u][v] = g[v][u] = 1;
    }
    rep(i, 1, n+ 1){
        rep(j, 1, n+1){
            if(g[i][j] == 0)
            g[i][j] = inf;
        }
    }
    
    if (g[1][n] == 1) {
        rep(i, 1, n+1){
            rep(j, 1, n+1){
                if(i == j) continue;
                g[i][j] = (g[i][j] == 1 ? inf : 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    rep(k, 1, n+1){
        rep(i, 1, n+1){
            rep(j, 1, n+1){
                g[i][j] = min(g[i][j], g[i][k] + g[k][j]);
                
            }
        }
    }
    if(g[1][n] >= inf) cout << "-1\n";
    else cout << g[1][n] << '\n';
}
int main(){

    solve();

    return 0;
}
```
