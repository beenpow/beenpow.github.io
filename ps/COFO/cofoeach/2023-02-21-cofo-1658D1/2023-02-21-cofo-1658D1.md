# COFO::1658D1 388535 (Easy version)
- [Link : COFO::1658D1](https://codeforces.com/contest/1658/problem/D1)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : bitmasks, math
- TIME
  - to understand    : 15
  - to algorithm     : 80
  - to code          : 10
  - to debug         : 0
  - understanding edit and solve with edit: 2
  - Tried to solve the problem before read edit : 

### Point
- There are l and r and array a length of r - l + 1 which is a permutation of the array [l, l+1, ..., r]
- b[i] = a[i] ^ x
- We only get array b, find any x
  - Also, for this problem l is always 0

### Design
- It took a while to figure out
- But I guess the reason it's taking long time is that I solved only a few XOR problems
- Anyways, finding the logic took a while but the logic is very smple
- Let's see numbers from 0 to 15
  - 0000
  - 0001
  - 0010
  - 0011
  - 0100
  - 0101
  - 0110
  - 0111
  - 1000
  - 1001
  - 1010
  - 1011
  - 1100
  - 1101
  - 1110
  - 1111
  - For each index, always start with 0
    - For example, for second index, 0 -> 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 0 -> 1 -> 1

- Let's count 0s and 1s for each position from array a
  - If cnt0 is 0 for this index from all a[i], it means that all a[i] at this position have '1'
    - If there were both 0 and 1 in the original array for this index, either cnt0 or cnt1 can not be '0'
    - So, we know that this index of bits is not used from the original array
    - But cnt0 is 0, so we now know that this bit for the x is '1'. (Because 0 xor 1 is 1)
  - If cnt1 is 0 for this index from all a[i], it means that all a[i] at this position have '0'
    - And it works same way as i described on the above paragraph
    - So, this bit for x is '0'.
  - There are three more cases
    - if (cnt0 == cnt1)
      - In this case, x can be either 0 or 1
    - elif (cnt0 > cnt1)
      - Since we know, numbers start with '0' in the original array, and it is same here.
      - So, it is not flipped, x for this bit will be '0'
    - elif (cnt0 < cnt1)
      - As I showed you the binary numbers from 0 to 15, they starts with 0.
      - So, cnt1 can not be greater than cnt0 in the original array
      - It means, it is flipped by x, so this bit for x is '1'

[TC2]

x[3] !x[2] x[1] x[0]
x[3]  x[2]  x[1] x[0]
----------
  0     1       0    0   (4)


x[3] ![x2] ![x1] !x[0]
x[3]   x[2]   x[1]  x[0]
----------
0        1      1      1 (7)


x[3] ![x2] ![x1] x[0]
x[3]  x[2]   x[1] x[0]
----------
0       1      1     0 (6)


x[3] ![x2] x[1] !x[0]
x[3]  x[2] x[1]  x[0]
----------
0      1       0      1 (5)


x 를 유추해보자
	- 아래 수가 0, 1, 2, 3에 매칭되어야한다.
	- 0000
	- 0001
	- 0010
	- 0011

x[3] !x[2] x[1] x[0]

x[3] !x[2] !x[1] !x[0]

x[3] !x[2] !x[1] x[0]

x[3] ![x2] x[1] !x[0]

--------------------
4/0   0/4 2/2  2/2

0 1 2 3 은 하위 2비트만 사용함.
따라서 x[3] 와 !x[2] 는 각각 0이 되어야함
즉, x[3] = 0, x[2] = 1
--------------------
나머지 x[1] 이랑 x[0] 는 어떻게 알아내지?




x = 0 1 0 0  임
x = 0 1 1 1  도 가능
