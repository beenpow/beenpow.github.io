# COFO::1498C Planar Reflections
- [Link : COFO::1498C](https://codeforces.com/contest/1498/problem/C)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : brute force, data structures, dp
- TIME
  - to understand    : 15
  - to algorithm     : 58
  - to code          : 10
  - to debug         : 10
  - understanding edit and solve with edit: 2
  - Tried to solve the problem before read edit : 

### Point
- n and k are given
- One particle is shooted from left side of 1st plane
  - Then it goes through n planes
  - If the particle meets a plane, another new particle is popped up for the oposite direction
  - Every particle has it's decay age
  - And the first particle has k, and every particle that is popped up for the opsite direction has -1 decay age from the origin

### Design
- You would get this is somekind of dp problem when you see the explanation as figure on the bottom
- But it took some time to figure how to solve it correctly
- And here's how
- First of all the particles go through left side of right side depend on it's decay age, so we have alternatively check left move and right mode
- Let's say the first particle is shooted for the right side with k
  - Then, the opisite new particles are shooted for the left side with k-1
  - Then, the opsitie new particles are shooted for the right side with k-2
  - ...
- Now we have to check how many particles would be newly generated.
- Well, let's make an example with n = 3
  - And we use array d[k][n], 
    - d[i][j] : On (k - i) decay aged particle layer, how many particles would face the jth plane
  - In general, we can find a equation
    - d[2][1] = d[1][2] + d[1][3]
    - d[2][2] = d[1][3]
    - d[2][3] = 0
    - d[3][1] = 0
    - d[3][2] = d[2][1]
    - d[3][3] = d[2][1] + d[2][2]
    - ...
  - You would see that this is only about suffix or prefix sum from one side to another
- And all you have to do this summing all prefix sums from each layer

<pre>
n = 3

 *  각 판을 통과하는 particle 의 갯수
	n = 1	n = 2	n = 3	curSum	
k = 1	1	1	1	. 	
k = 2	[1][2] + [1][3]	[1][3]	0	3	<----
	 = 2	= 1
k = 3	0	[2][1]	[2][1] + [2][2]	5	---->
		= 2	= 3
k = 4	[3][2] + [3][3]	[3][3]	0	8	<-----
	= 5	 = 3
k = 5	0	[4][1]	[4][1] + [4][2]	13	----->
		 = 5	 = 8

### Complexity

### Code

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;
const ll MOD = 1e9 + 7;

ll solve() {
    int n, k; cin >> n >> k;
    vector<vector<ll> > dp (max(n, k) + 2, vector<ll>(max(n, k) + 2, 0));
    if (k == 1) return 1;
    if (n == 1) return (k >= 2 ? 2 : 1);
    fill(&dp[1][1], &dp[1][n + 1], 1);
    
    bool f = false;
    ll ans = 2;
    for(int i = 2; i <= k; i++) {
        // left side
        if (!f) {
            for(int j = n - 1; j >= 1; j--)
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j+1] + dp[i-1][j+1]) % MOD;
            ans += dp[i][1];
            ans %= MOD;
        }
        // right side
        else {
            for(int j = 2; j <= n; j++)
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j-1] + dp[i-1][j-1]) % MOD;
            ans += dp[i][n];
            ans %= MOD;
        }
        f = !f;
    }
    
    return ans;
}
int main(){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);
    
    int tc; cin >> tc; while(tc--)
        cout << solve() << '\n';
    return 0;
}
