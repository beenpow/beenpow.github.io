# COFO::1363C Game on Leaves
- [Link : COFO::1363C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1363/C)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : games, trees
- TIME
  - to understand    : 5
  - to algorithm     : 15
  - to code          : 5
  - to debug         : 0
  - understanding edit : 0 

### Point
- There's a unrooted tree
- Players make the following move in turns
  - Take on leaf node, and remove it
- Ayush and Ashish play games optimally, and determine who's going to win when Ayush do first
- The one removed 'x' node is going to win the game

### Design
- The point of solving this problem is about 'optimal move'
- What is optimal move for this problem?
- Let's say there are two subtrees for x
  - sub1 : has 3 nodes total
  - sub2 : has 4 nodes total
  - If Ayush start removing sub2 and Ashish follow to remove nodes from sub2, then Ayush will win the game
  - But it's not optimal for Ashish, cuz he/she knew he/she is going to lose the game when he/she deicde to remove nodes on sub2
  - So, optimally Ashish will remove sub1
  - Then the left nodes will be
    - sub1 : 2
    - sub2 : 3
  - Now Ayush will choose sub1, then Ashish will choose sub2 becuase if Ashish choose sub1 then Ayush will win the game
  - and so on ..
  - Then there will be like, 
  - sub1 : 1
  - sub2 : 0
  - And it's Ayush's turn and he/she wins the game
  - As you can see, they will remove n - 1 nodes to win or not to loose the game
- So we can decide who is going to win with only 'n'
  - If it has even number of nodes, Ayush will win
  - If it has odd number of nodes, Ashish will win
  - And there's only one exception, which is 
    - When x is leaf node from the beginning, Ayush will win

### Complexity
- O(N)

### Code

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;
#define Ayush false
#define Ashish true

bool solve() {
    int n, x; cin >> n >> x;
    vector<int> a[n + 1];
    rep(i, 0, n-1){
        int u, v; cin >> u >> v;
        a[u].push_back(v);
        a[v].push_back(u);
    }
    // x 가 leaf 이거나, n이 짝수이면 Ayush 승
    if (sz(a[x]) <= 1 || n%2 == 0) return Ayush;
    return Ashish;
}
int main(){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);
    int tc; cin >> tc; while(tc--){
        if (solve() == Ayush) cout << "Ayush\n";
        else cout << "Ashish\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```
