# COFO::1748C Zero-Sum Prefixes
- [Link : COFO::1748C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1748/C)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : brute force, data structures, dp, greedy, implementation
- TIME
  - to understand    : 
  - to algorithm     : fail
  - to code          : 
  - to debug         : 
  - understanding edit : 20

### Point
- There is an array a
- Find the maximal count of subarray for their sum as 0.
- Also you can use below operation
  - Select an index i(1 <= i <= n) such that a[i] = 0
  - Then replace a[i] by an arbitrary integer

### Design
- The only option we have is that choosing arbitrary number for 0
- And, choosing 'x' when we meet 0 and the prefix sum of it is 'x' can not be the solution
  - There are lots of conterexample for this
  - ex) 3 0 2 -10 10 -30 30 0
  - answer for this example should be 4 not 2
- This problem can be solved with 'frequency'
  - If you spend enough time for this problem, you might think like 'This is about the substring between 0 and 0'.
  - But, it's hard to come up with frequency after all
- When we have subarray as a[l:r] and a[l] is zero, we should use a[l] as wiser as possbile to catch as many as 0 for the range of [l:r]
  - Let's say there's no 0 for the range [l+1:r] inclusive
  - Let's say s[l] as prefix sum for the array a[0:l]
- Then, we can choose most frequent prefix sum number between s[l] and s[r]
  - Let's say the number is 'x'
- Then we can use '-x' for the a[l], then we will have as many as zeros for the range of [l:r]

### Complexity
- O(NlogN)

### Code

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

int n;
void solve() {
    cin >> n;
    vector<ll> v(n, 0);
    
    bool NotFirst0 = false;
    map<ll, int> freq;
    ll ans = 0, curSum = 0;
    int mxFreq = 0;
    
    rep(i, 0, n) {
        cin >> v[i];
        if (v[i] == 0) {
            if (NotFirst0) {
                ans += mxFreq;
            } else ans += freq[0];
            
            freq.clear();
            mxFreq = 0;
            NotFirst0 = true;
        }
        curSum += v[i];
        mxFreq = max(mxFreq, ++freq[curSum]);
    }
    
    if (NotFirst0) ans += mxFreq;
    else ans += freq[0];
    
    cout << ans << '\n';
}

int main(){
    int tc; cin >> tc; while(tc--)
    solve();
    return 0;
}
