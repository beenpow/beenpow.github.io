# COFO::559A Gerald's Hexagon
- [Link : COFO::559A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/559/A)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : brute force, geometry, math
- TIME
  - to understand    : 
  - to algorithm     : fail
  - to code          : 
  - to debug         : 
  - understanding edit : 3

### Point
- There is an hexagon made of triangles
- We get the length of each side from hexagon
- Print the number of triangles to make the hexagon

### Design
- Couldn't figure out the trick
- By checking edit, now it's so clear.
- I was only thinking inside the box
- The truth is,
  - We don't think about hexagon, we only focus on triangles
  - Find the minimal length of equilateral triangle which includes the hexagon we get
  - Now we can get the count of triangles from equilateral triangle easily
    - if the length is k, count will be k^2
  - Then subtract three part of small equilateral triangles which is not included in the hexagon


### Complexity
- O(1)

### Code

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

ll a[6];
void solve() {
    rep(i, 0, 6) cin >> a[i];
    ll len = (a[0] + a[1] + a[2]);
    ll ans = len * len;
    ans -= a[0] * a[0];
    ans -= a[2] * a[2];
    ans -= a[4] * a[4];
    cout << ans << '\n';
}

int main(){
    solve();
    return 0;
}
```
