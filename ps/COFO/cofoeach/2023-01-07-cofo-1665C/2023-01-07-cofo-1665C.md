# COFO::1665 Tree Infection
- [Link : COFO::1665](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1665/C)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : binary search, greedy, sortings, tree
- TIME
  - to understand    : 
  - to algorithm     : fail
  - to code          : 
  - to debug         : 
  - understanding edit : 20
- spend more than two hours

### Point
- There's a tree
- each second two operation happenes
  - spread : if v's child is unhealty, that child can spread virus at most one other child of v
  - injection : choose indice 'v' and inject virus

### Design
- The logic is simple, but this is way more greedier than I thought
- Let' check how many parents exist and push children count to vector v
- Then we know that we need at least size(v) seconds to spread each parent's one child
- Also, to be greedy we need to sort v as desecnding order
  - And assume that we inject virus from the maximum count of children group first
  - Then, on i seconds( i <= v.size()), the healty children of i will be v[i] - v.size() + i
  - The reason we need to add 'i' is that, it took i seconds to inject first children of i
- Now we know how it works, and we can use binary search for the total seconds
- So, we choose the total seconds as 'mi' seconds
- And iterate all v[i]
  - And check if v[i] will have all children as 'unhealty' after 'mi' time
  - Which means, after v[i]'s first children got injected rest of them will be spread.
     - Is this enough?
  - If not, we need to spend some more injection we got to make them unhealty faster
- We'll know whether the injection we used was enough to make the time as 'mi' or not
- Simply, this logic can be said as 'Let's spend mi time for all. And need to focus on the vertex that has more than that'

### Complexity
- O(NlogN)

### Code

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

int BS(int lo, int hi, vector<int> v) {
    while(lo < hi) {
        int mi = (lo + hi) >> 1;
        
        int inj = mi - sz(v);
        rep(i, 0, sz(v)) {
            if (v[i] > mi - i) {
                inj -= (v[i] - (mi - i));
            } // else : mi 시간동안 spread가 다 된다
        }
        
        if (inj >= 0) hi = mi;
        else lo = mi + 1;
    }
    return lo;
}

void solve() {
    int n; cin >> n;
    map<int,int> mp;
    rep(i, 1, n) {
        int x; cin >> x;
        mp[x]++;
    }
    int I = sz(mp) + 1;
    int S = n - I;
    if (I > S){
        cout << I << '\n';
        return;
    }
    vector<int> v;
    for(auto it = mp.begin(); it != mp.end(); it++) v.push_back(it->second);
    v.push_back(1);
    
    sort(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int a, int b){return a > b;});
    int ans = BS(sz(v), n + 1, v);
    cout << ans << '\n';
}
int main(){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);
    int tc; cin >> tc; while(tc--) solve();
    return 0;
}
```
