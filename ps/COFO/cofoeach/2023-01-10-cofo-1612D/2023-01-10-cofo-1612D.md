## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : math, number theory
- TIME
  - to understand    : 
  - to algorithm     : fail
  - to code          : 
  - to debug         : 
  - understanding edit : 70

### Point
- We get a, b and x
- We can do below operation
  - set a = |a-b|
  - set b = |a-b|
- find if a can be x or b can be x

### Design
- It's necessary to observe to solve this problem by drawing tree-way

![img1](/img/2023-01-10-cofo-1612D-1.png)
- I made a tree with testcase two
- (a, b) and a is greater than b
- As you can see if the tree goes left side, there are always same pair on it's parent or parent's child
  - ex) check the red circles
- So, now we know that we don't need to make left side of the tree
  - We only need to focus on making right side of tree
- Right side is made by (a, b) -> (a-b, b)
  - We can do this all day, but it will cause Time Limit Excess
- Then there should be somthing make the algorithm faster
- (a, b) -> (a-b, b) -> (a-2b, b) -> (a-3b, b) -> ... -> (a-(q-1)b, b)-> (a-qb, b)
  - Let's say a-(q-a)b is greater than b
  - And a-qb is less than b
- If we can find q quickly, we can skip a few steps
- Then how can we find q ?
- Let's call a as
- a = qb + r 
  - r is reaminder of b, (0 <= r < b)
- Since we can get r by a % b, we don't need to find q, because we only needed a-qb which is r
- Now we can skip a few steps
- Then how can we know if there's a value which is equal to x, between (a, b) and (a-qb, b)
  - Let's say
  - a - ib = x (0 <= i <= q)
  - if a + x is divided by b, it means that there's 'i' exist
- So, now we can skip and find if there's any 'x' exist during the skip

### Complexity

### Code

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

// a > b
bool rec(ll a, ll b, ll x) {
    if (a < x && b < x) return false;
    if (a == x || b == x) return true;
    if (a == 0 || b == 0) return false;
    if ((a - x) % b == 0) return true;
    return rec(b, a%b, x);
}

void solve() {
    ll a, b, x;  cin >> a >> b >> x;
    if (rec(max(a, b), min(a, b), x)) cout << "YES\n";
    else cout << "NO\n";
}
int main(){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);
    int tc; cin >> tc; while(tc--) solve();
    return 0;
}
```
