# COFO::1753B Factorial Divisibility
- [Link : COFO::1753B](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1753/B)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : math, number theory
- TIME
  - to understand    : 
  - to algorithm     : fail
  - to code          : 
  - to debug         : 
  - understanding edit : 80

### Point
- When an array a is given, find if the sum of factorial is divisible by x

### Design
- It took so long time to understand, but didn't want to give up
- Obviously, it's hard to connect dots looking forward, I mean how can we relate 'sum of factorial' to x!
- To solve this problem, we need to keep change the form of the equation
- Let's say (a[1]! + a[2]!+ ... + a[n]!) is equal to (1! * cnt[1] + 2! * cnt[2] + 3! * cnt[3] ... )
- The answer is true if we can keep doing below sequence for all entries upto x-1
  - 1! * cnt[1] 
    - if cnt[1] is 2 * v1(random constant), 1! * cnt[1] can be added to 2! * cnt[2]
  - So, (1! * cnt[1]) + (2! * cnt[2]) will be
    - 2! * (cnt[2] + v1)
  - And if (cnt[2] + v1) is divisible by 3, we can express it like, 
    - 2! * (cnt[2] + v1) + 3! * (cnt[3]) = 3! (cnt[3] + v2)
- If we are able to express k! * (cnt[k]) as (k+1)! * something  upto (x-1), the result will be like (x-1)! * (cnt[x] + something)
  - Finally, if (cnt[x] + something) is divisible by x, the equation will be
  - x! * something
    - There's no more term like, (x+1)! * cnt[x+1] since a[i] is less than x
  - Now we know that the given array is divisible by x.

### Complexity
- O(X)

### Code

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 500009;

int n, x;
int cnt[MAXN];
bool solve() {
    cin >> n >> x;
    rep(i, 1, n + 1) {
        int t; cin >> t;
        cnt[t]++;
    }
    rep(i, 1, x) {
        int t = cnt[i] / (i + 1);
        cnt[i+1] += t;
        cnt[i] -= t * (i + 1);
        if (cnt[i]) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
int main(){
    if (solve()) cout << "Yes\n";
    else cout << "No\n";
    return 0;
}
```
