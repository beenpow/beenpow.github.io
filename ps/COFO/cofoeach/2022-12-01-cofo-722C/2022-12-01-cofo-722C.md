# COFO::722C Destroying Array
- [Link : COFO::722C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/722/C)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : data structures, dsu
- TIME
  - to understand    : 
  - to algorithm     : fail
  - to code          : 
  - to debug         : 
  - understanding edit : 30

### Point
- There's an array 'a' consistring of n non-negative integers
- We are going to destroy integers one by one
- Every time each element is destoyed, find maximum possible sum of exsting numbers

### Design
- Well,, I've thought about solving the problem in reverse way, but couldn't figure out how.
- Here's the solution
- We start with no number in the array ( reverse way )
- And we undestroy each number by referring the reversed permutation.
  - Let's say this number as 'x'
- When 'x' is alive, we need to check the range which includes 'x'
- And the bound for the range will be
  - LE : left bound : leftmost possible position of alive number
  - RI : right bound : rightmost possible position of alive number
  - So, we find LE and RI by referring 'alive postion set'
  - Then, we get sum of them by using prefix sum
  - And, if this sum is larger than previous one, this sum will be remain
- The important thing along the process is,
  - Every time we find [LE, RI] and get sum for the range, do we need to check other range if they are the maximum possible?
  - The answer is NO
  - Because, other ranges has been checked and if any of them was the maximum possible, it would be the remained one.
  - And, when we renew the table by undestoying 'x', there's no effect on ohter range.
  - Which means, we only need to focus on the range which inclues 'x'.


### Complexity
- O(NlogN)

### Code


```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 1e5 + 9;

int n;
int a[MAXN];
int perm[MAXN];
ll psum[MAXN];
set<int> b;
void solve() {
    cin >> n;
    rep(i, 1, n + 1) {
        cin >> a[i];
        psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i];
        b.insert(i);
    }
    b.insert(0);
    b.insert(n + 1);
    
    rep(i, 0, n) cin >> perm[i];
    
    vector<ll> ans;
    ll bst = 0;
    for(int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        ans.push_back(bst);
        int x = perm[i];
        b.erase(x);
        
        int x_prev = *--b.lower_bound(x);
        int x_next = *b.lower_bound(x);
        
        ll s = psum[x_next - 1] - psum[x_prev];
        if (s > bst) bst = s;
    }
    reverse(all(ans));
    rep(i, 0, sz(ans)) cout << ans[i] << '\n';
}

int main(){
    solve();
    return 0;
}
```
