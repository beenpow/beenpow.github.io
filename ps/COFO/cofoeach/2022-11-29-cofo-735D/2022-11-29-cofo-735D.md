# COFO::735D Taxes
- [Link : COFO::735D](https://codeforces.com/contest/735/problem/D)
- [Link : Goldbach's conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture)

## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : math, number theory
- TIME
  - to understand    : 
  - to algorithm     : fail
  - to code          : 
  - to debug         : 
  - understanding edit : 100

### Point
- n is given
  - Tax for n is maximum divisor of n(not equal to n)
- n1 + n2 + ... + nk = n (k =1 allowed)
  - Tax for n is sum of each value for n[i]
  - n[i] >=2 should hold

- Find minimal Tax

### Design
- I tried to figure out what the problem has
- Finally I found that there will be only a few values for the answer with prime number
 - ex) 1, 2, 3, 
- But couldn't know how many options that I have, and how to use prime number.
- Here's the number theory to this problem
  - It comes from Goldbach's conjecture
  - Any number can be expressed as sum of primes
- To solve this problem in optimal way, we have to use prime number as big as possible
  - Because the tax for prime number is only 1
- Here's the understandable things from Goldbach
  - if n is prime number, the anwer is 1
  - if n is even number, the answer is 2
    - Any even number can be experessed with two prime numbers
  - if n is odd number,
    - it can be expressed with 2 and n-2
    - since 2 is prime number, n-2 should be prime number
  - Otherwise the answer is 3
    - One of prime is 3
    - Then n-3 will be even number, so it can be expressed with two prime numbers

### Complexity
- O(logN)

### Code

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

bool isPrime(ll x) {
    for(ll i = 2; i * i <= x; i++) {
        if(x % i == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int solve() {
    ll n; cin >> n;
    
    if (isPrime(n)) return 1;
    
    if (n%2 == 0) return 2;
    else {
        if (isPrime(n-2)) return 2;
    }
    return 3;
}
int main(){
    cout << solve() << '\n';
    return 0;
}

```
