# COFO::1730B Meeting on the Line
- [Link : COFO::1730B](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1730/B)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : binary search, geometry, greedy, implementation, math, ternary search
- TIME
  - to understand    : 10
  - to algorithm     : 100
  - to code          : 3
  - to debug         : 0
  - understanding edit : 5
- Actually It took an hour and half to solve it

### Point
- There are n people
- They come to place x0
  - For i-th person, he or she starts from position x[i] and before he/she starts to move it takes t[i] time
  - So, it takes t[i] + |x[i] - x0| time to get to the position x0 for i-th person
- These people ask you to find a position x0 that minimizes the time in which all n people can gather at the meeting place

### Design
- It took quite a long time, but finally found the logic for this problem
- The soulution can be acquired by drawing x-y graphs
- Here's the answer
- Let's say spending time for i-th person as y[i] = t[i] + |x[i] - x0|
- Since it has one variable and absolute, the graph will be 'v' shape
- Then there will be n count of 'v' shapes on the x-y dimensions when you draw
- And we can find maximum y-value by choosing highst graph on that x-point
  - When you connect these y-values the graph shape will be 'v' too
  - And you'll notice that 
  - Left side of this 'v' shape graph comes from
    - the left side of graph who has maximum value on y-intercept
    - Let's say this graph's index is 'b'
    - y[b] = t[b] + x[b] - x0
  - Right side of this 'v' shape graph comes from
	- the right side of graph who has maximum value on y-intercept
    - Let's say this graph's index is 'a'
    - y[a] = t[a] + x0 - x[a]
- Then we can finalize the equation as below
- t[a] + x0 - x[a] = t[b] + x[b] - x0
- x0 = (x[a] + x[b] + t[b] - t[a]) / 2
- This will be the answer for this problem

### Complexity
- O(N)

### Code

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)

    int n; cin >> n;
    vector<int> x(n, 0), t(n, 0);
    rep(i, 0, n) cin >> x[i];

    int xa = -1, xb = -1, ta = -1, tb = -1;
    int mx_yi = -1e8 - 1;
    // find right side of v graph
    rep(i, 0, n) {
        int yi = t[i] - x[i];
        if (yi > mx_yi) {
            mx_yi = yi;
            xa = x[i], ta = t[i];
        }
    }
    
    mx_yi = -1e8 - 1;
    // find left side of v graph
    rep(i, 0, n) {
        int yi = t[i] + x[i];
        if (yi > mx_yi) {
            mx_yi = yi;
            xb = x[i], tb = t[i];
        }
    }
    double ans = xa + xb + tb - ta;
    ans /= 2;
    cout << fixed;
    cout.precision(6);
    
    cout << ans << '\n';
}

int main(){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);
    int tc; cin >> tc; while(tc--)
        solve();
    return 0;
}
