# COFO::1342C Yet Another Counting Problem
- [Link : COFO::1342C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1342/C)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : math, number theory
- TIME
  - to understand    : 
  - to algorithm     : fail
  - to code          : 
  - to debug         : 
  - understanding edit : 
- spent 3 hours to solve it, but I guess there was a hole on my code

### Point
- a and b are given
- when l and r is given, calculate how many numbers meet the below equation
  - l <= x <= r,
  - ((x mod a) mod b) != ((x mod b) mod a)

### Design
- Let's say b is greater than a
  - Left side : ((x mod a) mod b)
  - Right side : ((x mod b) mod a)
- I found out below facts
  - Left side is same as 'x mod a'
    - And the length of the pattern is 'a'
  - Right side has pattern like,
    - 0, 1, 2, ... a-1, 0, 1, 2, ..., b-a-1
    - And the length of the pattern is 'b'
  - So the one cycle of pattern is a * b
- But I couldn't get the correct answer, 
  - I guess the reason that I didn't get it was because of GCD of a and b
  - I didn't handle when a and b has GCD greater than 1
- Anyway, here's simple way to get the answer
- pre-calculate answers from 0 to a * b
  - Then just use it for the query
- With this way, it's very clear to get the answer and no holes in it.
- Notice that, a and b should be small as given numbers to solve this problem.
- What if they are very large numbers?

### Complexity
- O(a * b)

### Code

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

int a, b, q, len;
int p[200 * 200 + 9];

void build() {
    len = a * b;
    p[0] = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= len; i++) {
        p[i] = p[i-1];
        if (((i % a) % b) != ((i % b) % a))
            p[i]++;
    }
}
ll query(ll x) {
    ll cnt = x / len;
    ll r = x % len;
    ll ret = p[len] * cnt + p[r];
    return ret;
}
void solve() {
    cin >> a >> b >> q;
    
    build();
    
    while(q--){
        ll le, ri; cin >> le >> ri;
        ll ans = query(ri) - query(le - 1);
        cout << ans << " ";
    }cout << '\n';
}
int main(){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);
    int tc; cin >> tc; while(tc--)
        solve();
    return 0;
}
```
