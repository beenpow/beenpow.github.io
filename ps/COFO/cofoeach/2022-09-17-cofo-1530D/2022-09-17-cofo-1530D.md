# COFO::1530D Secret Santa
- [Link : COFO::1530D](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1530/D)


## Problem 

- level : 1600
- tag : constructive algorithms, flows, graphs, greedy, math
- TIME
  - to understand    : 5
  - to algorithm     : 20
  - to code          : 10
  - to debug         : 5
  - understanding edit : 5 

### Point
- There is an array consists of numbers from 1 to n randomly
- There could be same number in the array
- Find the maximum count of indices which don't need to change their value from the array.
  - You can change value to any number between 1 to n


### Design
- Well,, it's obvious that the maximum count is easily countable with given array
  - There will be same numbers in array, so all we need to do is pick only one number to stay and change others
- Then how can we handle for the same numbers?
- We can find numbers that need to be positioned by checking which number is unused from given array
- Then we just need to put the unused numbers to left positions.
- But we need to be careful, since we shouldn't put number i on index i.
- So, if this problem happens, easy way to solve is that we swap this number with the position of given number for this i.
  - Then it will always work
- Also, using front and rear number when matching left numbers is very good way to prevent numbers being positioned as value i to index i.
  - Because there's always two options.


### Complexity
- O(NlogN)

### Code

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

void solve() {
    int n; cin >> n;
    
    vector<int> a(n, 0), ori(n, 0);
    map<int,int> leftNumber;
	map<int,int> chosen;
    rep(i, 0, n) leftNumber[i + 1] = 1;
    
    int cnt = 0;
    rep(i, 0, n) {
	
        int x; cin >> x;
		ori[i] = x;
        if (leftNumber.find(x) == leftNumber.end() || x == i+1) {
            
        } else {
            cnt++;
            a[i] = x;
            leftNumber.erase(x);
			chosen[x] = i;
        }
    }
    
    vector<int> b;
    for(auto it = leftNumber.begin(); it != leftNumber.end(); it++){
        b.push_back(it->first);
    }
    
    int fr = 0, re = sz(b) - 1;
    rep(i, 0, n) if (a[i] == 0) {
        if (b[fr] != i + 1) {
            a[i] = b[fr++];
        } else if (b[re] != i + 1) {
            a[i] = b[re--];
        } else {
            // when fr == re
            a[i] = b[re];
			int id = chosen[ori[i]];
			swap(a[i], a[id]);
            //if (i + 1 < n) swap(a[i], a[i+1]);
            //else swap(a[i], a[i-1]);
            break;
        }
    }
    cout << cnt << '\n';
    rep(i, 0, n) cout << a[i] << " ";
    cout << '\n';
}
int main(){
    int tc; cin >> tc;
    while(tc--)
        solve();
    return 0;
}
