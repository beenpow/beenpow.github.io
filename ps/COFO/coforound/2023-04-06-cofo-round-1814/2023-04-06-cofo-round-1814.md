# COFO::Cofo Edu Round #146

  - B : -4
  - C :
  - rank : 9535
  - score : 1 solved

## Problem A : Coins

- level : not yet decided
- tag : math

### point
- k and n are given
- Find if x and y are exsit that match below equation
- 2 * x + k * y = n

### Design
- It seems bit hard, but the trick was hidden
- We have '2' that is multiplied to x
- Since 2 is the minimal even number, if n is even, we can just make it by setting y = 0, x = n/2
- When n is odd number,
  - we only need y = 1, then left number can be made by 2 * x

#### Big O(time)
- O(1)

### Code

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

void solve() {
    ll n, k; cin >> n >> k;
    if (n % 2 == 0) cout << "YES\n";
    else {
        if (k % 2 == 0) cout << "NO\n";
        else {
            cout << "YES\n";
        }
    }
}

int main(){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);
    
    int tc; cin >> tc; while(tc--)
        solve();
    return 0;
}
```

## Problem B : The Great Hero

- level : not yet decided
- tag : brute force, math

### Point
- Move from (0, 0) to (x, y) with the minimum operations
- operation when current positions is (a, b)
  - jump into the cell (a + m, b)
  - jump into the cell (a, b + m)
  - increase the length of the legs by 1, m += 1

### Design
- We can get the answer by iterating from 1 to 1e5
  - The iterated number would be the leg's length
  - So, we can get the count of operations by dividing x and y to the length
  - Also, there can be remainder from them
  - If remainder is greater than 0, we add 1 for each
  - This is the hidden logic for this problem
  - Since the remainder is less than leg's length, we can think like
    - While we are increasing the length and we hit the reaminder number, we use this first 
    - Then keep adding up until leg's length
- It seems easy logic to use, but it's hard to come up with the idea
- Also, the thing is we are using same leg's length for both x and y
- We need to think about why it is optimal

#### Big O(time)
- O(1e5)

### Code

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

void solve() {
    ll x, y; cin >> x >> y;
    
    ll ans = 1e9 * 2 + 9;
    for(ll i = 1; i * i <= 1e10; i++) {
        ll cnt = (i - 1);
        cnt += x / i;
        cnt += y / i;
        if (x%i) cnt++;
        if (y%i) cnt++;
        ans = min(ans, cnt);
    }
    cout << ans << '\n';
}

int main(){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);
    
    int tc; cin >> tc; while(tc--)
        solve();
    return 0;
}
```
