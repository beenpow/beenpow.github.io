## Problem A : Select Three Sticks 

- level : 
- tag : brute force, greedy, math, sortings

### point
- I get n sticks, their lenghts are a1, a2, ..., an
- I can prform any number of operations.
  - This is the operation
  - Choose one stick, and increase or decrease its length by 1.
  - The lenght should be strictly greater than 0
- Find the minimum number of operations to create an equilateral triangle with three sticks.


### Design
- Since we need to make same length of 3 sticks, first of all it's goot to sort the array
- The reason to sort array is to choose 3 sticks which has smallest length difference between them
- While iterating the array we choose 3 consecutive stickts, and find the gap as
  - gap = a[i] - a[i-1] + a[i+1] - a[i]
  - with this gap count of operation each stick's length will be same as a[i]

#### Big O(time)

#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;
int n;
ll a[3000];
void solve() {
    cin >> n;
    rep(i, 0, n) cin >> a[i];
    sort(a, a + n);
    ll ans = 1e9 * 4;
    rep(i, 0, n - 2) {
        ll ops = a[i+1] - a[i] + a[i+2] - a[i+1];
        ans = min(ans, ops);
    }
    cout << ans << '\n';
}
int main(){
    int tc; cin >> tc;
    while(tc--)
        solve();
    return 0;
}

```

## Problem B : Bright, Nice, Brilliant

- level : 
- tag : constructive algorithms

### Point
- I get n as a height of pyramid.
- The pyramid is made up like the way picture from the problem says.
- And the brightness of a room is defined as the sum of brightness of the room's parents.
- Find a pyramid when it's meeting below requirements.
  - Maximize 'Brilliance'
    - 'Brilliance' is the sum of brightness over the rooms (1,1), (2,1), ... (n, 1)
  - Each room from same floor has to have same brightness

### Design
- At first seeing the problem, I thought it would be so hard, because it has many pictures
- But luckily, I found easy way to solve it.
- Since we want to maximize the 'Brilliance', all of the lights from the left side rooms of the pyramid might need to be turned on.
- Let's say the left side is all turned on.
- Then we need to figure out how to amend other rooms.
- And here's the rule to make it simple.
  - Only left side and right side of the pyramid need to be turned on.

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()

#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

int n;
void solve (){
    cin >> n;
    rep(i, 1, n + 1) {
        rep(j, 1, i + 1) {
            if (j == 1 || j == i) cout << "1 ";
            else cout << "0 ";
        }cout << '\n';
    }
}
int main(){
    int tc; cin >> tc;
    while(tc--)
        solve();
    return 0;
}

```

## Problem C : Removing Smallest Multiples

- level : 
- tag : brute force, greedy, math

### Point
- I get 'S' and it contains n positive integers from 1 to n
- I also get 'T'
  - if T[i] is 1, then it means it has i as a member
  - else, then it does not have it.
- Print the smallest cost if you can make S to T $y doing below operations.
  - Choose a positive integer k ( 1 <= k <= n ), such that there exists a multiple of k in S.
  - Then, delete the smallest multiple of k from S.
  - This operation requres a cost of k

### Design
- As a naive ways,
  - For all the numbers from T[1] to T[n]
  - I can use k as T[i]
- Then cost will not be the minimum one.
- To make the lowest cost, 
  - If I want to erase 'X' from S, I need to use one of divisors for X.
  - The tricky part is that I can not use any of divisors sometimes.
  - Also, finding all the divisors on every i will cost lots of time complexity.
  - Since n is 1e6, finding divisor will be 1e3 at max
    - So, totally it will be 1e9 which is TLE.
- Then all I need to do is that finding right divisor for X in time.
- To do that, I can use 'Sieve of Eratosthenes' kind of manner.
- Which means,
  - iterating i from 1 to n
  - With i, I can find possible 'X's by multiplying i.

    cin >> n >> T;
    T = '0' + T;
    vector<bool>dne(n + 1, 0);
    ll ans = 0;
    for(ll i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for(ll j = 1; j * i <= n; j++) {
            if (dne[i * j]) continue;
            if (T[i * j] == '1') break;
            else {
                ans += i;
                T[i * j] = '1';
                dne[i * j] = true;
            }
        }

## Problem D : Slime Escape
- level : 
- tag :  dp, greedy, implementation, two pointers
- During the test, I thought about lots of possibilities of solving the problem.
  - But, I could not define a way to resolve this problem in O(N).

### Point
- You get n and k and array a
- There are n Slimes in array a, and their health is a[i]
- You start from [k]th Slime and find if you can make it to the [0] or [n+1]
  - When you move from position A to B, if there is Slime in position B,
  - Your health will be added with a[B]
- If you can not go all the way to 0 or n+1 by not getting dead, print 'yes'.
- When your health is under 0, you are dead. 

### Design
- The way to solve this problem is two pointer.
- But I think the key part is understanding the greedy way.
- This is the tactic to find the answer.
  - 1. from k + 1 find the subarray starts from k + 1 and their sum is over '0'.
  - 2. Then it's necessary to memorize the mimimum value of sum during that.
  - 3. Then, start 1. again from the end point + 1 of previous one until it iterates all right side numbers from k
  - 4. Find if I can go to point '0' by doing below tactic.
    - Add as many as positive health if my health is not going under '0' by adding right side(memorized).
      - Since we memorized the positive sum, it will be helpful.
      - But, we need to check if the sum is greater than the minimum value.
      - Becuase if the health is under 0, I will be dead.
    - Since I absorbed as many as positive sums from right side, it's optimal.
    - So, I need to add left side of my position
    - Then keep doing number 4. until I get to point '0'.
  - Do it 4 again after reversing the array.
