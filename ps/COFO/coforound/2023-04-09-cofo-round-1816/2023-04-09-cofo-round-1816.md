## Problem A : Ian Visits Mary

- level : 800
- tag : constructive algorithms, geometry

### point
- End point (x, y) is given
- Starts from (0, 0) and move to end point by using at most 2 jumps
  - Let's say that we jump from (0, 0) to (a, b), and (x, y)
  - When there is a virtual line from (0, 0) to (a, b) and (a, b) to (x, y), there shouldn't be any integer point on the line


### Design
- There is a simple trick behind this problem, but it's not that easy to find
- When (x, y) is given, we can move to (1, y-1) then (x, y)
  - It means that we can use '1 width' solution.

### Code

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

void solve() {
    ll x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    if (x == 0) {
        cout << "2\n";
        cout << "1 0\n";
    }
    else if (y == 0) {
        cout << "2\n";
        cout << "0 1\n";
    }
    else {
        cout << "2\n";
        if (y + 1 > 1e9) cout << "1 " << y -1 << '\n';
        else cout << "1 " << y + 1 << '\n';
    }
    cout << x << " " << y << '\n';
}

int main(){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);

        solve();
    return 0;
}

## Problem B : Grid Reconstruction

- level : 1000
- tag : constructive algorithms, greedy

### Point
- 2 x n grid is given, where n is an even integer
- You may place the integers 1, 2, 3, ..., 2n on the grid
- Construct a way to place the integers on the grid, such that the minimum cost over all paths from (1, 1) to (2, n) is maximized.
- The cost of the path is a[1] - a[2] + a[3] - a[4] + ...

### Design
- There are many paths from (1, 1) to (2, n)
- To maximize all the paths, we need to make the cost of dispresion low
- First of all, there is an observation for this problem
- Let's say
  - plus array : a[1], a[3], a[5], ...
  - minus array : [a2], a[4], a[6], ...
- We need to maximize plus array and minimize minus array obviously
- Let's think about where the plus array would be put for 2 x n grid
  - It's zig-zag style
  - graph[1][1] + graph[2][2] + graph[1][3] + graph[2][4] + ...
- You can also come up with the minus array idea
- Now we know that the positions of plus array or minus array are fixed.
- So, we need to put all the large numbers into plus array and put all the small numbers into minus array
- There is a last thing to remember
- To make the cost of dispresion low, we can put thing this way
  - graph[2][1] (minus array)
  - graph[1][2] (minus array) = graph[2][1] + 1
  - graph[2][2] (plus array)
  - graph[1][3] (plus array) = graph[2][2] + 1
  - ...

#define fi first
#define se second
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i <(b); i++)
#define r_rep(i, a, b) for(int i = (a); i >(b); i--)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

int a[3][100009];
void solve() {
    int n; cin >> n;
    int bot = 1, top = 2 * n;
    a[1][1] = top--;
    a[2][n] = top--;
    
    int cur = 2;
    rep(j, 2, n) {
        a[cur][j] = top--;
        cur = (cur == 2 ? 1 : 2);
    }
    cur = 2;
    rep(j, 1, n + 1) {
        int nxt = (cur == 2 ? 1 : 2);
        a[cur][j] = bot + 1;
        a[nxt][j+1] = bot;
        bot += 2;
        j++;
        
    }
    rep(i, 1, 3) {
        rep(j, 1, n + 1) {
            cout << a[i][j] << " ";
        }cout << '\n';
    }
}

int main(){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);

## Problem C : Ian and Array Sorting

- level : 1300
- tag : math, sortings

### Point
- Array a is given, and try to make a as non-decreasing order by doing the follwing finitely many times
  - a[i] += 1, a[i+1] += 1
  - or
  - a[i] -= 1, a[i+1] -= 1
- Find if it's possible to make the array as non-decreasing order

### Design
- To make the array as non-decreasing ordey, a[i+1] - a[i] >= 0 holds
- Since the smallest value ( = a[i+1] - a[i] ) is 0, we can use as many operations to make it as '0'
- Then we can check if the last value of a is greater than or equal to 0 or not
- Also, there's one more thing for this problem
- If n is odd number, the answer is always YES
  - Let's make an example for this
  - There is a array A, the length of it is 5
  - A[1] A[2] A[3] A[4] A[5]
    - As I approach the problem, I make A[1] to A[4] as 0
  - Then the array will be
  - 0 0 0 0 (A[1] - A[2] + A[3] - A[4] + A[5])
  - Now I can pair A[1] and A[2] together and A[3] and A[4] together
  - So I can make A[1] and A[2] as number x
  - I can mke A[3] and A[4] as number y
  - If x <= y <= A[5] holds, the answer is yes
  - Since A[1] and A[2] are same and A[3] and A[4] are same as '0', we can make any number with the operations!

    rep(i, 0, n-1) {
        a[i+1] -= a[i];
        a[i] -= a[i];
    }
    if (n%2 || a[n-1] >= 0) cout << "YES\n";
    else cout << "NO\n";
