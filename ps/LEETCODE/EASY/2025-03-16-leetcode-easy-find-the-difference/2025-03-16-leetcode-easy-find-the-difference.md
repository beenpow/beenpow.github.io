# Leetcode::find the difference
- [Link : Leetcode:find the difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/description/?envType=company&envId=google&favoriteSlug=google-thirty-days)
- Solved, 1 1 3 0 5
- level : easy

# point
- You are given two strings s and t.
- String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
- Return the letter that was added to t.

# Design
- I've solved with a extra count array which count lowercase alphabets.
- Also, there is a incredibly way to solve this problem by Editorial.
- We can simply use 'xor' operation through iteration.
- By just 'XOR'ing through iteration for both strings, we end up knowing that one character has no pair.
- So it last, which is the answer.

# Big O(time)
- With Extra Count array
  - TIME : O(N)
  - SPACE : O(1) (constant used)
- With bit manipulation
  - TIME : O(N)
  - SPACE : O(1)

# Code

## With Extra count array

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        int cnt[26] = {0, };
        for (auto x : t) cnt[x - 'a']++;
        for (auto x : s) cnt[x - 'a']--;
        for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++) if (cnt[i] > 0) return i + 'a';
        return -1;
    }
};
```

## With bit manipulation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        char ch = 0;
        for (auto x : t) ch ^= x;
        for (auto x : s) ch ^= x;
        return ch;
    }
};
```
