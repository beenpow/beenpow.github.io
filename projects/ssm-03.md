# Gesture-Based Control

## Project Duration
2015.10.09 - 2016.01.12

## Purpose and Motivation
This project provides an IoT platform service based on audio recognition using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The goal is to include many products in the Internet of Things by connecting switch buttons attached to general products to the network and providing detachable hardware and platform APIs to users.

## Development Environment
- **IDE:** Android Studio, Visual Studio

## Development Schedule
- **2015.10.09 - 2015.11.08:** Program planning and environment setup
- **2015.11.09 - 2015.12.08:** Core functionality implementation and UI design
- **2015.12.09 - 2016.01.09:** Program integration and debugging

## Innovation and Excellence
This project enables IoT services based on voice recognition, allowing control of products without touching or seeing them. It provides detachable hardware that can be applied in daily life without modifying existing products controlled by switch buttons, and offers APIs applicable to Android and Windows systems.

## Applicability and Business Potential
By using motors to control switch buttons, products can be connected to the network without modification. Unlike traditional IoT systems, there is no need to set up new systems, saving costs. The project is distributed as open source for Android and Windows systems, making it easy to apply to many systems.

## Background

The Internet of Things (IoT) is the concept of giving objects the ability to identify themselves, communicate, and be controlled over a network. IoT has applications in personal, industrial, and public sectors. Examples include Smart Cars that connect vehicles to the internet for safe and convenient driving, and Smart Homes that connect household appliances to the internet. In the industrial sector, IoT enhances productivity and safety by integrating IoT technology into production, processing, and distribution. In the public sector, IoT information from CCTV, GPS for the elderly, etc., is used to prevent disasters.

FingerSnap aims to provide an IoT platform by connecting many objects to the network through switch buttons, enabling control without physical contact using audio recognition and making it applicable to many systems through open source.

## Development Purpose

This project provides an IoT platform based on audio recognition using FFT. By controlling switch buttons, many objects can be connected to the network without modification and controlled without touch using audio recognition. It aims to provide open-source APIs applicable to many systems, allowing control through FingerSnap.

The goal is to enable a platform where many objects focus on the user, connect to the network, and communicate with each other.

## Technology Trends

### 1) IoT (Internet of Things)

IoT refers to the technology of embedding sensors and communication functions in various objects to connect them to the internet. Examples include home appliances, mobile devices, wearable computers, and other embedded systems. Objects connected to IoT need unique IP addresses and may include sensors for data acquisition from the environment. IoT development must address the security challenges posed by the potential for all connected objects to be hacked.

According to Gartner, the number of objects using IoT technology was 900 million by 2009 and is expected to reach 26 billion by 2020. The vast amount of data generated by connected objects, known as Big Data, requires the development of efficient algorithms for analysis.

### 2) Audio Recognition

Recent advancements in audio recognition technology enable various applications. The widespread use of smartphones has made media recognition easier. Smartphones come equipped with microphones, sound devices, cameras, and networking capabilities, making them suitable for recording and processing sounds, capturing images, and exchanging data with remote servers. Examples include Google’s and Naver’s voice recognition programs, among other services.

### 3) Smart Home

A Smart Home supports automation and may include various automatic control techniques (lighting, temperature, doors, security systems, etc.). Smart Homes can be controlled via centralized controllers or wirelessly. They aim to enhance comfort, convenience, and energy efficiency in homes, making Smart Homes a critical part of the IoT landscape.

### 4) Smart Car

The convergence of automotive and IT technologies has accelerated the emergence of Smart Cars. These vehicles integrate LTE networks, app stores, and entertainment, information, and productivity features for a futuristic driving experience. Smart Cars aim to enhance safety and convenience by integrating mobile and telecommunication technologies. IT and automotive companies are collaborating to create new ecosystems. At CES 2014, several companies showcased their automotive technologies, highlighting the trends of connectivity, wearable devices, eco-friendly vehicles, autonomous driving, smartphone apps, and proprietary app stores, indicating the growing overlap between automobiles and consumer electronics.

## Development Goals

### 1) Architecture
The architecture is divided into Core, Server, Android, Windows, and Hardware components.
- **Core:** Develop libraries for Fourier transform algorithms and band-pass filters. These libraries are used by Android, Windows, and Hardware code.
- **Server:** Store user IDs for registered hardware and manage OAuth processes.
- **Android:** Focus on user convenience, voice recognition, frequency analysis, Bluetooth communication with hardware, and HTTP communication to send user IDs to the server.
- **Windows:** Log on computers or implement system macros based on recognized voice input from Android (using Fourier transform and band-pass filter).
- **Hardware:** Perform actions based on signals received from Android. This role is suitable for the current transitional IoT market and will eventually be integrated into building design.

## Development Content

### 1) Server
The server facilitates OAuth services, allowing application developers to easily integrate OAuth using the open-source API provided by the project. It manages user authentication for unique hardware modules and delegates group management to other users.

### 2) Core
The core module uses FFT for audio recognition to detect FingerSnap patterns. This module enables remote control of the project’s products. FingerSnap patterns involve distinct sounds made by the thumb and middle finger (first), middle finger and palm (second), and thumb and index finger (third), which are unique to humans. An audio sensing algorithm is developed to detect these patterns using smartphones. The project plans to upgrade the detection algorithm to distinguish FingerSnap patterns among individuals.

### 3) Android
The Android app recognizes audio sensors and controls hardware modules. The main screen resembles a music player with flip-style content. Users can trigger macros by touching images or snapping fingers (FingerSnap).

### 4) WPF
**Main Features:**
- **Windows Lock Screen:** Secure lock screen activated by FingerSnap or a pre-set password.
- **PPT Auto-Slide:** Automatically advances slides during presentations with FingerSnap.
- **Auto Login:** Automatically logs into websites like Naver with FingerSnap.
- **Auto Webtoon Scroll:** Scrolls webtoons with FingerSnap.
- **User Macro Settings:** Allows users to set and execute macros with FingerSnap.

### 5) Hardware
Hardware communicates with Android via Bluetooth and allows users to control home devices like lights and door locks using FingerSnap. The system includes a motor for each switch button, an MCU, and a battery. The setup connects to Android via Bluetooth and allows control using predefined protocols.
